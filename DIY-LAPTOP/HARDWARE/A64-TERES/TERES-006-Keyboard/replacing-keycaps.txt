To remove a keycap:

	As mentioned in "Components", do not lift the keycap from the lower edge.  This
	can break the plastic snaps that connect the inner key retainer on that edge.

	Place a small tool under the upper edge of the keycap and lift until it snaps
	away a little.  This frees and angles the keycap enough to remove it more
	safely.

	It's likely that the key retainer is dislodged during removal of the keycap.
	It should be reassembled before the keycap is replaced.

To replace a keycap:

	There are a few approaches to this.  Here's what seemed simple to me:

	1. First make sure the retainer is fully assembled by snapping the hinge slots
	on the inner part onto the hinge pegs of the outer part, so it lays flat as
	described in "Components" below.

	2. Use a small tool to slide the plastic tongue of the inner part of the
	retainer underneath the metal lip near the top of the key area, designed to
	hold it on the circuitboard.  The plastic slides underneath the metal lip from
	above, downwards.

	3. Orient and press the lower hinges to fit around the metal pegs on the main
	board, making sure the plastic tongue stays underneath the metal lip on the
	other side.

	4. Use pressure to snap the keycap into place.

Components:
	1. Keycap

	  The keycap has two plastic feet under the upper edge, and two delicate
	plastic snaps under the lower edge.

	  The delicate plastic snaps connect to the inner key retainer.

	  Do not pull on the delicate snaps with the inner key retainer unless the
	keycap is at a sufficiently large angle for the inner plastic to snap out from
	the side.  Otherwise they will break.

	2. Inner retainer

	  The inner key retainer floats between everything, hanging off the underside
	of the keycap with hinges snapped into the outer key retainer and is shaped so
	as to safely connect to the other parts only when force is applied at certain
	orientations to each connection.

	  The snaps at the bottom are shaped so as to safely pop out of the keycap only
	when angled away.  The connecting material of these snaps is much thicker when
	viewed from above than from the side, and will break the keycap snaps if forced
	out in a parallel up-and-down manner, i.e. with the thick orientation forced
	through the keycap snaps.  When removing a keycap, it must be initially lifted
	from the upper edge only so as to avoid this.

	  The hinges in the middle are slotted to snap into the outer key retainer
	below them.  This makes the two key retainer parts separable.  They will only
	snap back together if everything is at the right orientation and the inner key
	retainer hinge snaps are resting on top of the outer key retainer hinge pegs.

	  The tongue at the top of the inner key retainer slides under a metal lip on
	the keyboard, holding the inner key retainer onto the keybaord.

	3. Outer retainer

	  The outer key retainer rests underneath the inner key retainer, and
	aroundside it.

	  The hinge pegs of the outer key retainer snap into the underside of the
	slotted hinges in the inner key retainer.

	  The lower hinges connect to the larger keyboard, and have grooves inside them
	for the upper keycap hinges from the inner key retainer to rest in to.

	2 & 3. Assembled retainer

	  The key retainer lays flat, with the two parts flush, when assembled together.

	4. Key pad

	  The key pad is a circular bit of stretchy material that is removably glued to
	the circuit board underneath everything else, and registers the keypress.
